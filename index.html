            <h2>XP per Level Analysis</h2>
            
            <h3>CONTEXT</h3>
            <p>Levels 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, and 20 are talent tier levels and represent power spikes for both teams. The spike in experience (and time) required to reach key levels dictates the time duration before, during and after a talent advantage/disadvantage. Knowing when and where your best teamfight windows are is critical to strategy in competitive play.</p>
            
            <div class="chart-section">
                <h3>XP per Level - Chart Preview</h3>
                <img src="assets/HotS_Charts/HotS_xp_per_Level.png" alt="XP per Level Chart" class="xp-chart">

            <div class="analysis-points">
                <h3>Insights and Use Cases</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Levels 6-7:</strong> ~60% SPIKE in experience required to reach level 7. For teams behind in experience, this creates a prolonged window to fight on talent parity and mount a comeback before the enemy team hits level 7's substantial power spike. However, if an advantage is gained, this represents a prolonged advantage, as the losing team must still accumulate the 6-7 experience.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Levels 9-10:</strong> ~40% DROP in experience required to reach level 10. After the experience-advantaged team hits level 9, the window for the behind team to fight on talent parity (and ultimate parity) becomes very small.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Levels 16-17:</strong> ~30% SPIKE in experience required to reach level 17. With level 16 being the power spike and relatively easy to get, xp wise, there is no opportunity window for a disadvantaged team.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Kill XP vs Level:</strong> Kill experience remains relatively proportional to XP required—no strategic advantage gained here.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Kill XP at Level 20:</strong> Kill experience DOUBLES at level 20. Team fighting becomes extremely valuable late game. This is widely recognized.</li>

                    <li>Highlight the ratio of passive experience gain vs minion experience vs kills</li>
                    <li>Compare kill experience vs farming minion waves, factoring in death timers</li>
                    <li>Analyze how many minion waves can be missed before fighting enemy teams becomes unprofitable in early game</li>

            <h2>HP per Hero - Analysis</h2>
            
            <h3>CONTEXT</h3>
            <p>Understanding each hero's HP level is critical for gameplay. Since most heroes function identically at 1% HP versus 100% HP, developing strong intuition for each hero's relative HP is essential for prioritizing targets to efficiently defeat enemy teams.</p>
            
            <div class="note">
                <strong>NOTE:</strong> Since numerical values fluctuate with hero levels throughout each game, understanding a hero's RELATIVE HP is the key insight. For this reason, specific numerical values have been omitted from this visualization.
            </div>
            
            <p>For this HP analysis, I'll examine notable entries in the chart. While HP affects dueling ability, it primarily determines a hero's ability to survive combined burst damage from an enemy team. This analysis focuses primarily on that aspect. I will not comment on survivability gained through technical abilities like invisibility, teleports, dashes, etc.</p>
