# Heroes of the Storm - Analysis
## My Background
I'm Michael Salata, a former competitive Heroes of the Storm player specializing in tank roles, macro strategy and shot-calling.
**Competitive Achievements:**
- Led a team to victory in multiple weekly ESL Heroes of the Storm tournaments, earning prize money
- Shot-called for hundreds of competitive matches
- Coached an amateur team that subsequently achieved placements in their own competitive tournaments

## What This Is
I've created a simple website that showcases a small selection of the strategic analysis I developed for competitive Heroes of the Storm play. While my team and I typically worked with raw data and brief summaries, I've expanded these analyses with detailed explanations to make the strategic insights accessible to newer and non-competitive players.
